title: Normal Delivery vs. Cesarean Section - The Situation in Vietnam
---

In Vietnam, nearly half of all births in 2021—49.6%—were by cesarean section (C-section). This is a staggering figure compared to the 10–15% rate recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). With such a high number of C-sections, there’s growing concern about whether this procedure is being overused, potentially affecting the health and well-being of both mothers and babies. So why is this happening, and do the benefits of C-sections outweigh the risks?

Childbirth is generally seen as a natural process that doesn’t usually need medical intervention. However, normal vaginal delivery has become less and less common in Vietnam over the past few decades. The C-section rate has shot up from 3.4% in 1994, to 27.5% in 2014 [1], and then all the way to 49.6% in 2021 [2]. While C-sections make sense for women who’ve had one before, they’re also being performed in a surprisingly high number of cases where the pregnancy is full-term, and the woman has no previous uterine scars—up to 40.7% [3]. There are a few key reasons behind this increasing trend.

One of the biggest factors is personal preference. A study found that 34% of pregnant women actually preferred C-sections over vaginal delivery [4]. This preference is often influenced by family members who’ve had C-sections or by women’s own experiences. They trust the procedure and don’t see it as something to be afraid of. Plus, many consider the cost to be affordable.

The type of healthcare facility also plays a role. Women who give birth in private hospitals are 1.6 times more likely to have a C-section compared to those in public hospitals [2]. Where you live matters too—women in cities are more likely to have C-sections than those in rural areas (43.2% vs 30.4%). And interestingly, wealthier women are more likely to choose C-sections, with the rates being 44.2% among the richest and 19.1% among the poorest [5].

Education is another factor, with a noticeable gap in C-section rates between women with different levels of education. For example, women with vocational high school education have a 50.1% C-section rate, while those with little or no education have a rate of just 19.4% [5]. This raises the question: Does higher education lead to better decision-making around childbirth?

It’s not quite that simple. While C-sections can be necessary and lifesaving in some cases, vaginal delivery is generally seen as the safer and more natural option when possible. It typically leads to a quicker recovery, fewer complications in future pregnancies, and is better for the baby’s health. C-sections, on the other hand, come with more risks and a longer recovery time.

In my next post, I’ll dive deeper into the pros and cons of each method, helping future mothers make informed and evidence-based decisions about their delivery options.
