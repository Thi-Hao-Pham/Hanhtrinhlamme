title: Week 10 of Pregnancy - Exciting Changes for Both You and Your Baby
---

Congratulations, you’ve reached the 10-week milestone in your pregnancy! At this stage, remarkable developments are taking place both in your body and with your growing baby. Let’s explore what you can expect during this exciting time.

## What's Happening with Your Baby at 10 Weeks
Your baby, although still tiny, is experiencing a rapid growth phase. By the end of this week, your little one will measure about four centimeters from head to bottom. While that may seem small, it’s incredible to consider how much has already formed. The major organs are in place and ready to continue developing and maturing.

One of the most notable changes is the formation of the placenta and the umbilical cord, which now provide vital nourishment and oxygen to your baby. The head is growing quickly to accommodate the developing brain, and the tiny auricles (or ear flaps) are now visible. The body is lengthening, and while the fingers and toes are still slightly webbed, they are becoming more distinct.

The growth doesn't stop there—your baby will grow about two centimeters each week from here on out. The little tail that once gave your baby a tadpole-like appearance has now disappeared, and the heart is beating strong and steady at around 150 beats per minute.

## How Your Body is Changing at 10 Weeks
As your baby grows, so does your body. By week 10, your uterus has expanded to about the size of an orange, which might start to make your clothes feel a bit snug. Many women find that looser clothing is more comfortable during this time.

You might also notice that you feel warmer than usual. This is due to the increase in blood volume in your body, which is necessary to support your growing baby. Along with these changes, you may experience constipation, which is a common side effect of pregnancy. The slowing down of your digestive system allows for better absorption of nutrients, ensuring that both you and your baby are getting what you need.

To ease any discomfort from bloating, consider incorporating more fiber into your diet. Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are excellent choices that can help keep things moving smoothly.

As you continue on this amazing journey, remember to take care of yourself and enjoy the wonder of the changes happening inside you. Each week brings you closer to meeting your little one, and week 10 is a significant step along the way!
