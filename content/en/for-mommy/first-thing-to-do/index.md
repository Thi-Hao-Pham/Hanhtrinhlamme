Seeing those two lines on your pregnancy test is an unforgettable moment—one filled with excitement, emotions, and maybe a touch of anxiety. This is a magical time, but it’s also when you need to focus on a few important steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy. It’s not about making announcements or planning celebrations just yet; the most crucial things to do first involve your healthcare and well-being.

## Making Appointments with Your Healthcare Provider
In Vietnam, as in many places, your first step should be scheduling an appointment with an obstetrician. This initial visit is essential and sets the stage for your entire pregnancy journey. During this appointment, you'll discuss your expected due date, overall health, medical history, and any previous pregnancies. This information will help your obstetrician determine which tests, precautions, and follow-up appointments are necessary throughout your pregnancy and after your baby is born.

## Making a Plan for a Healthy Pregnancy
Your healthcare provider will give you vital information about medical checkups, diet, nutrition, and physical activity during pregnancy. However, it's up to you to put this advice into practice and commit to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Understanding the importance of adopting healthy habits—and eliminating harmful ones—is crucial during your journey as a mother-to-be. Remember, staying committed to your health decisions is key to ensuring a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby.

### Don’ts: Habits to Avoid
#### 1. Drugs, Alcohol, and Caffeine
-	Drugs: Using drugs during pregnancy can severely harm your baby, affecting brain development and other organs. It may also lead to improper growth or withdrawal symptoms after birth.
-	Alcohol: Alcohol is equally harmful, with no safe amount during pregnancy. Drinking can damage your baby’s brain and organs, leading to poor growth, premature birth, or low birth weight.
-	Caffeine: Limit your intake of caffeine, found in coffee, soft drinks, and energy drinks. Try to consume no more than one energy drink a day, as excessive caffeine can also affect your baby's health.
#### 2. Smoking
Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and placental issues. It can harm your baby’s organs, impede growth, and cause premature birth or low birth weight. These complications can lead to long-term health issues like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity as your child grows older.

### Do’s: Healthy Habits to Adopt
Being pregnant doesn't mean you should stop being active. On the contrary, maintaining your regular physical activities, taking necessary vitamins, and ensuring proper nutrition are all important. Listen to your body and make adjustments as needed.

#### 1. Taking Vitamins
-	Folic Acid: Folic acid is crucial in reducing the risk of birth defects like spina bifida, cleft lip, and cleft palate. As recommended by The National Health Service in England, pregnant women should take 0.4 milligrams of folic acid daily until 12 weeks of your pregnancy.
-	Vitamin D: Vitamin D is essential for your baby’s bone development. It helps regulate calcium and phosphate in the body, which are crucial for healthy bones, teeth, and muscles. Ensure you're getting enough Vitamin D through diet or supplements, as advised by your healthcare provider.
-	Other Vitamins: In addition to folic acid and Vitamin D, your healthcare provider might recommend other prenatal vitamins that provide the essential nutrients needed for a healthy pregnancy. These might include iron, which helps prevent anemia, calcium, which supports your baby’s bone development, and Vitamin C to protect cells and help keep them healthy.

#### 2. Sports and Exercise
Engaging in physical activity during pregnancy has numerous benefits. It helps improve your mood, boosts energy levels, promotes better sleep, and can even alleviate some pregnancy-related discomforts like back pain. You can continue activities like walking, cycling, swimming, and working out, but avoid overexerting yourself or starting new intense sports. If you feel discomfort during exercise, scale back to a level that feels comfortable.

#### 3. Having Sex as Normal When There Are No Medical Concerns
If your healthcare provider hasn't advised against it, you can continue to have sex during pregnancy. Contrary to some myths, sex doesn’t cause miscarriages or harm your unborn baby. In fact, it can have benefits, such as reducing stress, strengthening the pelvic floor muscles, and improving your overall mood and connection with your partner.

#### 4. Relaxation
Stress management is important for both you and your baby’s health. Prolonged stress can have negative effects, so it’s important to find ways to relax. This might include practicing mindfulness, engaging in gentle yoga, or simply setting aside time to unwind.

In conclusion, the early stages of pregnancy are a time to prioritize your health and well-being. By making informed decisions, staying active, and avoiding harmful substances, you’ll be well on your way to a healthy pregnancy and a happy, healthy baby.
