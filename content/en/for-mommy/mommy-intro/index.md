Congratulations—you’re pregnant! Pregnancy is a natural experience, yet it feels uniquely special, almost magical. Throughout this time, you will undergo numerous changes, each unfolding in its own way. These changes vary significantly from one woman to another. Some women feel well throughout the entire nine months, while others experience a range of pregnancy-related symptoms. Some can work until their due date, while others may need to reduce their workload or stop working earlier.

As you navigate this journey, it is common to have many questions:
-	What should you eat during pregnancy? What foods are best avoided?
-	If you take medication, what adjustments should you make during pregnancy?
-	Can you continue working, exercising, and playing sports? For how long?
-	How should you manage pregnancy-related symptoms? When should you contact your healthcare provider immediately?

In this blog, I aim to address the most important topics that will hopefully clear your doubts and help you become a confident mother. Trust in yourself—motherhood is an instinctive skill, and your body is naturally designed for this incredible responsibility.

While pregnancy is a joyful time for many women and their partners, it may not be so for everyone. At times, pregnancy may be unplanned, or there may be concerns about your relationship, work, finances, or the course of the pregnancy itself. However, I will not discuss how to make decisions about whether to continue your pregnancy; I trust that you will make the best decision for yourself and your baby. Remember, everything happens for a reason, and it happens for you, not to you. If you choose to make this journey meaningful and memorable, I am here to support you every step of the way.
