Hello to all the mommies, daddies, and everyone eager to learn about the incredible journey to motherhood. Thank you for visiting my website and considering it a trusted resource to support you on this remarkable path.

## About me

![Author Picture](/author/author.jpg)

My name is Hao Pham. I hold a bachelor’s degree in pharmacy, a research master’s degree in epidemiology with a focus on health systems and prevention, and I’m currently pursuing a PhD in health economics. My professional journey began as a clinical pharmacist at an international hospital in Vietnam, where I took great pride in supporting doctors to select optimal treatments, training healthcare professionals about medications, and guiding patients to better health through drug consultations.

I’ve also worked as a clinical research associate, ensuring the integrity of clinical trials so their results could be trusted. Additionally, I served as a product specialist and training specialist, sharing my pharmaceutical knowledge with medical representatives and the general public. Currently, I’m a doctoral researcher in health economics, where my work aims to assist decision-makers in implementing effective public health interventions. I also work as a market access consultant, helping to generate evidence on the risks and benefits of healthcare products to optimize disease prevention and treatment for populations. My diverse background and work experience equip me to deliver scientifically accurate and reliable information to you.

## Purpose of this website

Beyond my professional qualifications, my most personal motivation for creating this website is that I am on the mother-to-be journey myself. This experience has been nothing short of magical, filled with emotions and profound happiness. However, I also know that this journey can be fraught with worries, stress, and anxiety, especially for first-time mothers like myself. It doesn’t have to be this way. Every expectant mother deserves to enjoy this journey and find happiness throughout it. I believe that empowerment through Knowledge and encouragement can dispel the fear and overwhelm that many women face.
I have a deep understanding of the Vietnamese healthcare context, including the challenges of public health education. There is an abundance of copied and pasted online information, yet a scarcity of tailored, reliable advice from healthcare providers. Additionally, over-reliance on healthcare professionals can sometimes diminish women’s trust in their own natural instincts regarding childbirth and childcare. Through this website, I aim to empower all Vietnamese women to trust their abilities and make informed decisions. You have the power to make your journey to motherhood joyful and memorable, and I’m here to help you achieve that.
